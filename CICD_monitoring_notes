What is CI CD ??

Continuous integration and continuous deployment

We build a pipeline

We build the code

Deploy the code
We automate it

We use plugins for integration

Automatically deploy enhancements 


What is SDLC ??
Software Development Lifecycle

From the time the software is developed till it reaches the client / customer 

Building the packages - build steps

Archiving or packaging the complete code/program

For eg - 
Windows based applications are developed using .Net

I get a file called as .exe or .msi

Mostly packages are —
Java - jar
Nodejs - tar file with xml
.net - .exe or .msi


Monolithic vs micro service ??

Big code broken into pieces - 

Shell process - 

Su - ubuntu —> creates a shell (process id 101) 
 — run dd command in bg 102
 — run vi 
  — nodes app
 — run bash 104

Flipkart - jar (single jar)
 — homepage
 — categories
 — cart
 — payment
 — orders
 — login

Monolithic means —> in one single code base, it has all the features -> if something goes wrong, whole application will be down, in case of a patching or a new feature release, you have to build the complete package
Eg - for small organization with less customer base 
It is tightly coupled with each other 

Microservice 
It is not tightly coupled with each other , 
Flipkart  —>
 — homepage - war
 — categories - jar
 — cart - .net
 — payment - nodes
 — orders - python
 — login - jar


SDLC 

Feature or requirement or new enhancement
Architecture ,Code base will be decided
Code will be developed
Code is scanned (integrity, syntax errors, code quality checks, etc)
Code is built
Tested
Deployed to the actual server from where the client can access
Monitor 


Waterfall 
Agile 

Creating tickets tasks —> epic, feature, user story, task where it will be planned execution
Quarter - once in 3 months - Fiscal/financial Year FY, 4 quarters , 
Season planning 


Under agile - devops model, create a bug —> 

Feature request —> create a feature in the board with all the details —> assigned to dev —> send for approval to test and deploy —> testing —> deployed —> monitored —> deployed to staging env —> deployed to production env
Conitunous integration and continously deployed 



Code - source code 

Local machine - developers own system —> laptop or a desktop
 —> dev / integration environment (aws ec2, VMware )
Servers for applications, for database, for middleware , etc
—> staging / sandbox environment, (production grade replica / clone)
—> production environment	

SCm - source code management , Version control systems
GIT - command or package used
Eg - GitHub, gitlab, bitbucket, azure devops, etc
Main or master branch 

CircleCI, etc

Jenkins - automation tool

Once the code is build to a jar or war or .exe file or tar file, this is a build artifact 
Artifacts are not uploaded usually to the same repository, it will be uploaded to artifactory tools like jfrog, nexus, etc


GitHub —> aws codecommit
Jenkins pipeline —> aws code pipeline 
To build a package , Jenkins (maven) —> aws code build 
Artifacts - nexus, jfrog —> aww code artifacts


Azure - azure devops


Cloudwatch - 
It is used for monitoring all the aws resources , it has metrics, events , logs , alarms and dashboards.


Metrics - 
Eg - cpu, mem/RAM, storage, network in/out, disk IOPS, rate, latencies, etc


Events —>
Status, health checks, messages, reasons, ,etc - events

Logs - 
Detailed information about the system or raw information 

Alarms - 
Monitors
Sitting a threshold and triggering an alarm 
For eg - monitor the RAM/MEM usage , it should not go above 75 percent, for last 5 mins, periodically check

Native - cpu usage, disk usage, network usage, etc
Custom metrics - no of processes run by user ubuntu , command


1 physical serve in aws - 100 VMs (cpu will be dedicated)
For eg - second VM —> 1 core, 1 GB Memory, 
From the above, 1 core will be allocated from physical server, the 1 GB is elastic, 300 MB of utilization, only that much will be occupied from the physical server, 

What is SNS - 
Its a simple notification service
, concept - pub/sub
Publishing / subscribing 
Cloud watch will publish a value or a message to SNS
We will subscribe to sns topic like CPU alarm, we will receive the notification

Recipients - whom the notification should be sent - subscribers
Topic - cloud watch or other service can publish their message to a topic in SNS




Async - 
SNS - more of a FIFO
U send the message and forget it
Someone will subscribe and receive the message


SQS - Sync way
Simple queue service 

If u have micro services, from one service to another service it can send some messages and things to process 
For eg - in flipkart, the cart page can send for processing if order is placed to order service , 3 replicas, 
To manage the messaging, we use messaging queues, —> Producers and consumers

Eg - SQS , apache ActiveMQ,, Kafka 
Install and configure kafka, dev will tell who is the producer and consumer and they will configure it



Monitoring tools and alternatives - 
Cloud watch - only aws and aws related resources
Nagios, icinga, zabbix, prometheus

The above are for infra monitoring
For backend applications, you can monitor the thread usage , latency, requests coming to and from other apps, correlation, logs 
Application Performance Monitoring - APM 

For web application or browser based applications — Real user monitoring  (RUM) or synthetic monitoring

URL based monitoring - uptime monitoring

Logs - logs monitoring

Observability stack- all infra, APM, logs, synthetics etc monitoring under one tool for correlation 
Eg - New Relic, Datadog, Splunk, ELK, Dynatrace etc
Free ones - Elastic (ELK), prometheus Grafana

SRE- Create SLA, SLO/SLI , MTTR , etc
